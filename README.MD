# Ruby Loops Lab
<strong>This guide assumes you have Ruby installed on your machine, a text editor, and a Github account already in place.</strong>

In this lab we will write 3 different methods inside the `lib/loops.rb` file. 

1. `times_of_contempt` method uses the `times` loop, takes an argument of a number, and increments that number as you watch all 8 episodes of The Witcher.
2. `while_you_were_watching` method uses a while loop to cast the Igni sign repeatedly until all monsters are defeated!
3. `the_law_of_until` method counts down the months left until The Witcher season 2, and celebrates when it arrives. (hint: use an `if` conditional for the last line!)

# Installation 
To get started, fork this lab to your GitHub account, copy the repo url, then in your terminal enter:

```
git clone {repo url}
```
<<<<<<< HEAD

This will create a repository in your github and download your repo to your local machine so you can start working on it. When you solved all test cases follow thes steps:

```
git add .
```
This will add all files in your current directory to be committed to Github.

```
git commit -m "Done."
```
This will commit the changes you made and ready them to be pushed to Github. The `-m "Done."' part will add a message expalaining your commit.

```
git push
```
This will push your changes to the associated Github repo.
