# Ruby Loops Lab

In this lab we will write 3 different methods inside the `lib/loops.rb` file. 

1. `times_of_contempt` method uses the `times` loop, takes an argument of a number, and increments that number as you watch all 8 episodes of The Witcher.
2. `while_you_were_watching` method uses a while loop to cast the Igni sign repeatedly until all monsters are defeated!
3. `the_law_of_until` method counts down the months left until The Witcher season 2, and celebrates when it arrives. (hint: use an `if` conditional for the last line!)
